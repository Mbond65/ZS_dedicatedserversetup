# ZS_dedicatedserversetup
A script for downloading and configuring SteamCMD, GMOD server and ZS
<br/>
<h3> Description </h3>
This script aims to do the time consuming job of installing a ZS dedicated server, leaving you more time to focus on adding maps and custom addons. The script which takes around five minutes to complete (dependant on internet connection and computer speed) installs SteamCMD, Gmod server binaries and ULX Addon.

Once the script has finished you simply need to execute one command to get the server up and running, you will then need to create a server config file and add maps etc (instructions in script).

If you do want to allow other people to join you will need to both make changes to firewall rules on the server and the firewall in your home network, when I get time I will write up some instructions on how to do this.

<h3> How to install </h3>
1.) Create a directory for SteamCMD (Eg. C:\Steam)
2.) Create a directory for Gmod (Eg. C:\Gmod)
3.) Run the script
